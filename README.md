Some code for running Stuck Note by Scot Gresham Lancaster


Installation instructions can be found on the HowTo.scd file.

Users/Teachers wanting to do an SC-only version of this should
see lork-notes.scd and lork.scd.

Users/Teachers who would rather use pd, should see pd-brdige.scd
and pd-receiver.

People looking for pd ideas should see [The PD Patch Respository](http://www.pdpatchrepo.info/)
